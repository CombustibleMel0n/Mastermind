# Mastermind
A simple mastermind program I made to learn a bit of Python, feel free to use it. It's pretty basic and probably not very optimized since I'm a beginner.

The programm will chose 5 random numbers between 1 and 8 and you'll have 12 tries to discover the combination.
The thing is, you will only know how many numbers you have in the combination AND at the right spot 
and how many numbers you have in the combination but not in the right spot. But it will not tell you which ones.

For example if the random combination is 12345 :
If you enter 21388 the program will tell you you have 1 number in the right spot (3) and 2 in wrong spots (2 and 1)

Enjoy and if you notice anything odd contact me !
